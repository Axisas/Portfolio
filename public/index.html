          <br />
          I am a student at NHL Stenden Leeuwarden, where I am halfway through
          my Communication and Multimedia Design study. I focus on back-end
          development and solving the intrincacies that are part of this. Before
          this I worked on various front-end web applications, serious games and
          games purely for entertainment.

        <p>
          <br />
          I focus on back-end development where I am working on several projects
          using Laravel. These projects are in a very early state however.
          Besides these I have however worked on several personal and school
          projects related to web development and game development. Within these
          I specialized on creating games and serious games made in Unity, as
          well as programming in JavaScript for various web applications, often
          with interactive learning elements. Check them out below:

        <button type="button" onclick="location.href = 'projects.html'">
          Projects

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>
          <br />
          I am currently working with Laravel/PHP. Besides this I have decent
          experience working in Unity with C#, as well as having worked a decent
          amount with JavaScript for web-based apps, and a bit of UnReal Engine
          5. I am also obviously familiar with Git(Hub). Besides these I am also
          familiar with accessibility and making digital products accessible for
          everyone.
