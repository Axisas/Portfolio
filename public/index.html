        <p>
          <br />
          I am a student at NHL Stenden Leeuwarden, where I am halfway through
          my Communication and Multimedia Design study. I focus on creating
          games and applications that can help people of any kind with issues
          they might face. Besides this my passion is making things for people
          to enjoy.

          <br />
          I have worked on several personal and school projects related to web
          development and game development. Within these I specialize on
          creating games and serious games made in Unity, as well as programming
          in JavaScript for various web applications, often with interactive
          learning elements. I also made this website from scratch using
          Javascript. Checkout the
          <a href="https://github.com/Axisas/portfolio">GitHub</a> for the
          source code.

          My main experience comes from working in Unity in C#, however I also
          have worked a decent amount with JavaScript for web-based apps, as
          well as a bit of UnReal Engine 5. Besides these I know how to work
          with GitHub.
