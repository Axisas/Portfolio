        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          <br />
          I am a student at NHL Stenden Leeuwarden, where I am halfway through
          my Communication and Multimedia Design study. I focus on creating
          games and applications that can help people of any kind with issues
          they might face. Besides this my passion is making things for people
          to enjoy.

          I have worked on several personal and school projects related to web
          development and game development. Within these I specialize on
          creating games and serious games made in Unity, as well as programming
          in JavaScript for various web applications, often with interactive
          learning elements.
