  `This was a project that I worked on during the second half of 2022-2023 with a team of 5 people.
  For this project I was the programmer.
  The goal of this project was to make a serious game to promote people with cooperating,
  as well as teaching them how to do this in a natural manner.
  <br><br>
  The game is made using Unity and C#, it is also the first time
  I experimented with adding local multiplayer to a game. As is visible in the demo below, 
  one of the features of the game is that every decision you make dynamically updates on everyone's version of the game. 
  <br><br>
  The main gameplay-loop of the game is every player making
  independent choices that affect general statistics negatively or positively,
  with the goal of the game being to keep all of these balanced. 
  The difficulty here arises in the fact that the players do not know what choices the others are making,
  and have to discuss this, without mentioning their choices outright.`
